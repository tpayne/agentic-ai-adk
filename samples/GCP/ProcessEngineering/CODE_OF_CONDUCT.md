## Project Responsibilities

Maintainers are responsible for clarifying standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned with this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for behaviors they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces, including GitHub repositories, issues, pull requests, discussions, and community channels, and it also applies when an individual is officially representing the project in public spaces.

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

All maintainers are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.
