The primary goal is to minimize lost sales and customer dissatisfaction by ensuring product availability through proactive monitoring, efficient inter-departmental communication, and effective inventory management practices. The process encompasses identifying stock-outs, verifying the shortage, performing a root cause analysis, taking immediate actions, placing replenishment orders, fulfilling the order, replenishing the inventory, and implementing preventive measures to minimize future stock-out occurrences.
