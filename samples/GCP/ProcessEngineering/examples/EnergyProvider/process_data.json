Questions include: precise location of the issue within the business premises, specific equipment affected, any error codes displayed, potential safety hazards, and a detailed description of the impact on business operations, including estimated downtime and financial losses. Data sources include: real-time power consumption data, voltage levels, and power quality metrics from the Meter Data Management System (MDMS); and network status, equipment health, and alarm data from the Network Management System (NMS). The questions asked and the customer's answers should be recorded in the incident record.",

Automated routing capabilities utilize a skills-based routing engine that considers the TSE's expertise in resolving similar incidents, their current workload, and their geographical proximity to the customer's site to optimize response times. Real-time availability of TSEs is tracked via the integrated workforce management system. The routing decision and the team to which the incident is assigned should be recorded.",
